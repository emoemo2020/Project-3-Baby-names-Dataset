# Project-3-Baby-names-Dataset

In these project I will be importing information of names of babies born in USA from US Government web-site. 

For each year of birth YYYY after 1879, there is a comma-delimited file called yobYYYY.txt. Each record in the individual annual files has the format "name,sex,number," where name is 2 to 15 characters, sex is M (male) or F (female) and "number" is the number of occurrences of the name.

I will be uniting, concatenating, cleaning these txt files and as a result I will have the csv file which I will be able to analyze properly.
